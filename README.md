1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tit0uanf/eveilm.git

Usage üõ†Ô∏è
-------

To use the EVM Bytecode Obfuscator, follow these steps:

Choose an input method:
```bash
$ python eveilm.py
Choose input method:
‚ùØ Paste Bytecode
  Select File
```


If you choose "Paste Bytecode", paste the bytecode and enter the contract name:
```bash
Please paste the bytecode (might get truncated): 6080604052...
What is the name of the contract ? MyContract
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the bytecode input contains both Creation and Runtime Bytecode


If you choose "Select File", select the file containing the bytecode under `/resources/original`:
```bash
Choose a file to obfuscate:
  USDC.evm
‚ùØ USDT.evm
  WETH.evm
```

> [!NOTE]
> The obfuscated bytecode are saved in `resources/obfuscated/MyContract.obf`

Obfuscation Techniques üé≠
-----------------------

These techniques are PoC obfuscation methods.


`ADD Opcode Stack Manipulation`: Obfuscates *ADD* opcodes by introducing additional manipulations.

`Function Signature Transformer`: Transforms function signatures to hide their name from decompilers.

`Control Flow Graph Spammer`: Insert random fake control flow paths.

`Jump Address Transformer`:  Obfuscate *JUMP* and *JUMPI* opcodes PC destination
